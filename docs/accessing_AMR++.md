# Accessing AMR++



This section will help you get access to all the bioinformatic tools required for metagenomic analysis with AMR++.

## Anaconda environment
-----------------




## Docker container
-----------------

Docker containers allow the packaging of multiple bioinformatic tools. While docker is a popular tool and likely to be supported by many computing clusters, please contact your system administrator for help with installing docker. Installation on a local computer is also an option and can be performed by following these instructions: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

We provide AMR++ with a docker container that is automatically accessed when running the AMR++ pipeline by using the flag, "-profile docker".
